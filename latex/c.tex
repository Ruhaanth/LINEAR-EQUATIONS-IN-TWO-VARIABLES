This is Problem 1 from Exercise 3.1
\begin{enumerate}
\item Aftab tells his daughter, "Seven years ago,
I was seven times as old as you were then. Also, three years from 
now, I shall be three times as old as you will be." [Isnt this interesting?] Represent this situation both algebraically and graphically.

\solution \\ Let us take Aftab's age as x and his daughter's age as y
"Seven years ago I was seven times as old as you were.
Therefore, x-7 = 7[y-7]
So, x-7y = -42. This is Equation 1.
"Three years from now, I shall be three times as old as you will be."
Therefore, x+3 = 3[y+3]
So, x+3 = 3y+9 
x-3y = 6. This is Equation 2.
