This is Problem 1 from Exercise 3.1
\begin{enumerate}
\item Aftab tells his daughter, "Seven years ago,
I was seven times as old as you were then. Also, three years from 
now, I shall be three times as old as you will be." [Isnt this interesting?] Represent this situation both algebraically and graphically.

\solution \\ Let us take Aftab's age as x and his daughter's age as y
"Seven years ago I was seven times as old as you were.\\
Therefore, x-7 = 7[y-7]\\
so,
"Three years from now, I shall be three times as old as you will be."
Therefore, x+3 = 3[y+3]\\
\begin{align}
x-7y = -42. \\
x-3y=6
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\myvec{1&-3\\1&-7}\myvec{x\\y}=\myvec{6\\-42}\\
\end{align}
\begin{align}
x =\frac{\mydet{ \vec{b} & \vec{a_2}}}{\mydet{ \vec{a_1} & \vec{a_2}}} = &
\frac{\mydet{6&-3\\-42&-7}}{ \mydet{1&-7\\1&-3}} =&
\frac{\brak{-6}\brak{-7} - \brak{-3}\brak{-42}}{\brak{1} \brak{-7}-
\brak{1}\brak{-3}} =& 42
\end{align}
Hence, Aftab's age is 42
\begin{align}
y = \frac{\mydet{ \vec{a_1} & \vec{b}}}{\mydet{ \vec{a_1} & \vec{a_2}}}=&
\frac{\mydet{1&6\\1&-42}}{ \mydet{1&-7\\1&3}}=&
\frac{\brak{1} \brak{-42} - \brak{1}\brak{6}}{\brak{1}\brak{-7} - \brak{1}\brak{-3}} =& 12
\end{align}
 Hence, Aftab's daughter's age is 12

\end{enumerate}
